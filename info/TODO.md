*Besides the obvious major stuff, here are the (more bug-related) TODOs:*

 - If a player does `//game leave` in the middle of the game, have their role revealed and mark them as dead (currently they just leave)
 - Actions should not be allowed unless a game has been started, the player has already joined, and the game has actually begun
 - Prevent the Gamemaster from leaving or joining the current game
